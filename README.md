## Purpose
dds-host is a console-based (for now) application that allows us to configure and write data to the Direct-Digital Synthesizer from a host controller (in this case a PC). The DDS uses an MCP2210 USB-to-SPI IC which enumerates as a HID. This lets us control the DDS using the HID interface; more specifically, this application leverages hidapi to communicate with the MCP2210. This project is currently very small while I figure out how to use HID devices in general and get comfortable with the MCP2210's interface in particular.
